### Projects

## Access Database: Student Grades and Transcripts
#### Summary:
 - For this project, I created a Microsoft Access database to manage student academic records. I designed a table to store student information, including first name, last name, mailing address, student ID, course codes, course names, semesters, and overall grades.
I built queries to organize and filter the data, making it easier to find specific student records, semester & overall GPA's, and generate a detailed manuscript for specific students.
In this image of my projecr, I created transcript reports for two students. Each transcript includes course details, semester GPA, and overall GPA. The reports were exported as PDFs.

#### Project Report:

 Initial project idea: 
- How did you come up with this project? What problem did you set out to solve, and why was it a problem that needed to be solved? 
    - This project was an assingmeent from my CS105 class where we learned how to use Access in order to build projects. The problem that i set out to solve was to make a access database where potential administrations can use an access database to create transcripts for students. 

Tools I used: 
- What tools did you use in completing this project? 
    - I used Microsoft Access, google, and excel. I used Access as the main software in making my queries and relationships. i used google to answer any questions i might have about acess that i need help on. And lastly, i used Excel as a .csv file to input my tables into the fields in Access. 

Challenges I faced:
- What challenges did you face, and how? What obstacles did you overcome? 
    - I had trouble with the formatting of the transcript. Using form wizard was harder to do than I originally thought. I watched youtube tutorials online to aid me in fixing up my transcript, and made sure that all the information was correct. 

Other Resources: 
    - I mainly used YouTube as it had very helpful guides to guide me through with using form wizard, making queries, building relationships, etc. 

Result:
- What did you set out to achieve? Did you achieve it? What improvements would you like to make if you had a chance to take this further? 
    - I set out to achieve a fully working access transcript where i could put all nessecary queries into one page. if i had more time on this assignment, I would create another page with an average calculator on how well a student does in each class and which classes they need more work on. 


#### Jdoodle Student Info Card
- Summary:
    - I built a Python program that asks for your name, major, and five classes, then prints it out like an info card. this allows for a clean and simple intro to input/output.

#### Project Report

- Initial Project Idea:
    - This was an assignment for my class to practice using Python inputs and outputs. I needed to make a program that collects basic student info and prints it back in a clean format.

- Tools I Used:
    - I used JDoodle to write and run my Python code and youtube to show me how to make any tricky lines of code.

- Challenges I Faced:
    - I didnt face much challenge while making this. I already had previous experience with python, but one thing i did have trouble with was Jdoodle website itself. Sometimes it would crash and not run the code, but I was able to fix it with a simple refresh button on the page. 

- Other Resources:
    - Youtube.

- Result:
    - I wanted to make a simple info card, and i was able to successfully do so with my previous knowledge on python. If I had more time, I’d add features like a loop or a nicer layout with colors (if it supported it).


#### Biweekly Time-Sheet Tracker for Small Companies

- Summary:
    - I created a two-week timesheet in Excel that calculates hours worked each day, subtracts breaks, and totals everything up. It could be useful for small companies who need help tracking employee hours.

#### Project Report

- Initial Project Idea:
    - This was an assignment for class to track work hours. This helps alleviate the need to write it down by hand or guessing. This provides a cleaner and automatic way to see total hours.

- Tools I Used:
    - I used Microsoft Excel to build the whole sheet. I used formulas for the time calculations and added totals for each week and the whole two-week period.

- Challenges I Faced:
    - Figuring out the time math with AM and PM took a little trial and error. I also had to make sure the break time didn’t mess up the total hours.

- Other Resources:
    - None.

- Result:
    - The results showcased a fully functioning time-sheet tracker. If I kept working on it, I’d probably add auto-pay calculations or overtime tracking.
