### Projects

#### Access Database: Student Grades and Transcripts
#### Summary:
 - For this project, I created a Microsoft Access database to manage student academic records. I designed a table to store student information, including first name, last name, mailing address, student ID, course codes, course names, semesters, and overall grades.
I built queries to organize and filter the data, making it easier to find specific student records, semester & overall GPA's, and generate a detailed manuscript for specific students.
In this image of my projecr, I created transcript reports for two students. Each transcript includes course details, semester GPA, and overall GPA. The reports were exported as PDFs.
