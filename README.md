### Projects

## Access Database: Student Grades and Transcripts
#### Summary:
 - For this project, I created a Microsoft Access database to manage student academic records. I designed a table to store student information, including first name, last name, mailing address, student ID, course codes, course names, semesters, and overall grades.
I built queries to organize and filter the data, making it easier to find specific student records, semester & overall GPA's, and generate a detailed manuscript for specific students.
In this image of my projecr, I created transcript reports for two students. Each transcript includes course details, semester GPA, and overall GPA. The reports were exported as PDFs.

#### Project Report:

 Initial project idea: 
- How did you come up with this project? What problem did you set out to solve, and why was it a problem that needed to be solved? 
    - This project was an assingmeent from my CS105 class where we learned how to use Access in order to build projects. The problem that i set out to solve was to make a access database where potential administrations can use an access database to create transcripts for students. 

Tools I used: 
- What tools did you use in completing this project? 
    - I used Microsoft Access, google, and excel. I used Access as the main software in making my queries and relationships. i used google to answer any questions i might have about acess that i need help on. And lastly, i used Excel as a .csv file to input my tables into the fields in Access. 

Challenges I faced:
- What challenges did you face, and how? What obstacles did you overcome? 
    - I had trouble with the formatting of the transcript. Using form wizard was harder to do than I originally thought. I watched youtube tutorials online to aid me in fixing up my transcript, and made sure that all the information was correct. 

Other Resources: 
    - I mainly used YouTube as it had very helpful guides to guide me through with using form wizard, making queries, building relationships, etc. 

Result:
- What did you set out to achieve? Did you achieve it? What improvements would you like to make if you had a chance to take this further? 
    - I set out to achieve a fully working access transcript where i could put all nessecary queries into one page. if i had more time on this assignment, I would create another page with an average calculator on how well a student does in each class and which classes they need more work on.
